This application provides the ability to create graphs based on rules the user provides in the UI. For now (18.01.2025) there is only the possibility to enter vertices and rules regarding the connections between them but with time there will more functionalities added.

As I am living in Austria, there is no English UI yet - definitely will prioritize that topic very strongly.

A star on Github would be greatly appreciated. In case there should be any issues or you are wishing for a specific functionality, feel free to open an issue and I will be more than happy to have a look at it. Also feel free to contribute to the development yourself by forking the repo.
